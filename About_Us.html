        <h1>About US</h1>
        <p>This is a platform dedicated to promoting mental health awareness and support in Nepal. Mental health is an essential yet often overlooked 
	part of well-being, and in Nepal, it faces significant challenges. With limited awareness, stigma, and a lack of accessible services,
	many individuals have difficulty accessing mental health services. The mental health need is immense in country like Nepal which is
	geographically complex, and has seen years of war durin Maoist insurgency, the big earthquakes, and the various natural disasters that frequently
	affect the lives of general people and add burden, not only financial but more significantly psychological. Most of our youths find the country 
	with no scope for thier future ambitions and are compelled to migrate abroad. Many time the families who are left behind have to suffer the 
	consequences of migration. Upto now, in Nepal there are only 241 registered psychiatrists and around 35 clinical psychologist to serve 30 million
	people. The prevalence of mental health issues is as high. According to the National Mental Health Survey conducted in 2019 and 2020 reports 
	that 23% of the Nepali population are seeking treatment for mental health issues. The sucide rate is nearing 20 per day with 7000 people dying
	every year. The allocated budget for mental health is very minimal.  The ratio of mental health professionals to general population is staggering
	In Nepal. Mental health in nepal is thus plaqued by dire shortage of human resouces, the priority of the government is still in physical
	infrastructure and other developmental tasks, stigma is prevalent in nepalese society and is a buring issue in rural communities where
	rituals such as "chhaupadi" is still practiced. 
	well-being.</p>
